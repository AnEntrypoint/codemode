# CodeMode Agent Changelog

## Latest Enhancements

### Comprehensive Colored Output
- Added `chalk` for terminal colors and styling
- Added `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting of code blocks
- Implemented comprehensive output formatting with sections, headers, and visual separators
- Color-coded different output types:
  - **Yellow**: Thinking blocks (ðŸ’­)
  - **Green**: Responses and completions (âœ“)
  - **Blue**: Tool usage (ðŸ”§)
  - **Red**: Errors (âœ—)
  - **Gray**: Meta information and borders

### Extended Thinking Support
- Enabled Claude's extended thinking mode with 10,000 token budget
- Real-time streaming of thinking process with `thinking_delta` events
- Visual display of thinking blocks with borders and numbering
- Comprehensive event handling for all message types

### Dynamic Tool Descriptions
- Created `getBuiltInToolSchemas()` to define tool schemas programmatically
- Updated `generateMCPFunctions()` to collect and return tool descriptions
- Execute tool description now dynamically includes:
  - All built-in functions (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, LS, TodoWrite)
  - All MCP tools organized by server (glootie, playwright, vexify)
  - Complete parameter lists and descriptions for each tool

### Configuration Management
- Added `--nomcp` flag support to disable MCP tools
- Updated config loading to check directories in priority order:
  1. Current working directory (`./.codemode.json`)
  2. Library directory (`/path/to/codemode/.codemode.json`)
  3. User home directory (`~/.claude/.codemode.json`)
- Comprehensive logging of config loading process

### Code Formatting
- Line-numbered code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Color-coded tokens:
  - Keywords (magenta)
  - Strings (green)
  - Numbers (yellow)
  - Comments (gray)
  - Functions (blue/cyan)
  - Operators (white)

### Event Handling
- Comprehensive streaming event processing:
  - `text`: Regular text messages
  - `thinking_delta`/`thinking`: Thinking blocks with real-time streaming
  - `assistant`: Assistant responses with content blocks
  - `tool_result`: Tool execution results with previews
  - `error`: Error messages with stack traces
- Real-time progress updates during agent execution

### Error Handling
- Enhanced error display with colored output
- Stack trace inclusion for debugging
- Clear error messages with visual separators

## Features

### Built-in Functions (Dynamically Documented)
- **Read(file_path, offset?, limit?)**: Read file content with line numbers
- **Write(file_path, content)**: Write/overwrite files with directory creation
- **Edit(file_path, old_string, new_string, replace_all?)**: Exact string replacement
- **Glob(pattern, path?)**: File pattern matching
- **Grep(pattern, path?, options?)**: Ripgrep-powered content search
- **Bash(command, description?, timeout?)**: Shell command execution
- **LS(path?, show_hidden?, recursive?)**: Directory listing
- **TodoWrite(todos)**: Task tracking and progress display

### MCP Integration (Dynamically Documented)
- **glootie**: Code execution, AST analysis, caveat management
- **playwright**: 20+ browser automation tools
- **vexify**: Semantic code search

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
npx codemode-agent --agent "Your task here"

# Disable MCP tools
npx codemode-agent --agent "Your task here" --nomcp

# MCP server mode
npx codemode-agent --mcp
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`: Agent framework
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: MCP protocol support
- `chalk`: Terminal colors (v5.3.0+)
- `highlight.js`: Syntax highlighting
- `fast-glob`: File pattern matching
- `chokidar`: File watching
- `uuid`: Unique identifiers
- `which`: Command resolution
- `zod`: Schema validation

### Architecture
1. **cli.js**: Entry point routing to agent or MCP mode
2. **agent.js**: Claude agent with streaming, thinking, and colored output
3. **code-mode.js**: MCP server exposing execute tool with dynamic function injection

### Configuration
`.codemode.json` structure:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "glootie": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-glootie@latest"]
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    },
    "vexify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vexify@latest", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Thinking Mode
Extended thinking is enabled with a 10,000 token budget, allowing Claude to show its reasoning process in real-time. This provides visibility into the agent's decision-making and problem-solving approach.

### Dynamic Tool Descriptions
Tool descriptions are generated at runtime by:
1. Querying each MCP server for its tools
2. Extracting tool schemas from built-in function definitions
3. Formatting descriptions with parameter lists and documentation
4. Combining into comprehensive execute tool description

This ensures tool documentation stays in sync with implementation and allows for easy extension with new tools.

### Color Scheme
The color scheme is designed for readability on both light and dark terminals:
- Bold colors for headers and important information
- Gray for borders and meta information
- Semantic colors (green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings)
- Syntax highlighting follows standard conventions
